# Apple Plant Disease Detection

A Machine Learning project to automatically detect diseases in apple leaves using image data. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and classifies leaf images as healthy or diseased.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Detect apple leaf diseases using ML techniques.  
- **Dataset:** Apple leaf images collected from Kaggle.  
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier.  
- **Accuracy:** 88% on the test set.  
- **Libraries/Tools:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.  

## 🛠️ Features

- Preprocesses images for machine learning modeling.  
- Extracts features suitable for Random Forest classification.  
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.  
- Can classify new apple leaf images as healthy or diseased.  

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohit7-7/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
```
2.Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.Run the Python script to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
python apple_disease_detection.py
```

📈 Results

Achieved 88% accuracy on the test dataset.

Confusion matrix demonstrates the model's performance in classifying healthy vs diseased leaves.
